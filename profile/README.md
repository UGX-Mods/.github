## About

UGX-Mods is a modding team created in 2010 which originally modded for Call of Duty: World at War.

In June 2011 the UGX-Mods forum was launched and turned over the years into the biggest zombie modding forum for Call of Duty.


### High Quality of User Generated Content

UGX-Mods is known for high quality maps like UGX Cabin, UGX Christmas, UGX Comosea and UGX Requiem which featured the latest version of the award winning UGX Mod Standalone.

With the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and it's mod tools, UGX created two maps UGX Azreal and UGX Christmas Remastered and a light version of the UGX Mod for Black Ops 3

### Tools & Service
Besides modding and hosting / maintaining a forum, the UGX-Mods Team is also delivering tools to improve modding and playing mods.

Most mentionable is the UGX Map Manager, an application which downloads and installs mods which can be played then.
The next iteration of the successor is the UGX Launcher which is in active development by UGX-Mods.
